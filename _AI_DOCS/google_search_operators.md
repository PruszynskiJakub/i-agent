Google Search offers many techniques to improve your search results. These techniques range from basic to advanced, and using them can save you time and increase the accuracy of your searches[1][3].

**Common Google Search Operators:**
*   **Exact Phrase** Use quotation marks (" ") to search for an exact phrase[1][3]. For example, searching "inbound marketing" will yield results with that exact phrase[2][3].
*   **Exclude Words** Use a minus sign (-) before a word to exclude it from your search results[1][2]. For example, "inbound marketing -advertising" will find content about inbound marketing but exclude results containing the term "advertising"[2].
*   **Expand Results** Use the OR operator (in capital letters) to find results that include either one term or another[1]. For example, "rhythm OR blues" will find results containing either "rhythm," "blues," or both[1].
*   **Number Ranges** Use two periods (..) to search for a range of numbers[1]. For example, "wireless earbuds $75..$150" will search for wireless earbuds within that price range[1].
*   **Wildcard Search** Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to have Google fill in the missing word in a phrase[1]. For example, "the devil * details"[1].

**Advanced Search Operators:**
*   **Page Titles** Use "intitle:" before a word or phrase to search for specific words in the title of a page[1]. For example, "intitle:texas snowstorm"[1]. Use "allintitle:" to only search for pages with a specific term in the title[1].
*   **Search a Cache** Use "cache:" to find older versions of a page[1]. For example, "cache:whitehouse.gov"[1].
*   **Specific Words on a Page** Use "inurl:" to find matching results within a URL address[1]. For example, "inurl:nursing"[1].
*   **Search Within a Site** Use "site:" to get results from a specific website[1][3]. For example, "site:purdueglobal.edu business" will give you business-related results from the Purdue Global website[1].
*   **Synonyms** Use the "~" symbol in front of a word to include similar words or synonyms in your search[2]. For example, "inbound marketing" ~professional[2].
*   **Pages That Link to Another Page** Use "link:" followed by a page name to search for every website that cites that page[2]. For example, link:buzzfeed[2].
