- Write functional and declarative code and patterns related to it
- Use Python for all the code.
- Always follow the style of the code you're editing
- Use descriptive variable names such as `user_name` instead of `name`
- Use descriptive function names such as `set_interaction_state` instead of `updateInteraction`
- Fail early (exit function early) when possible and take care of error handling
- Use `uuid` for unique identifiers
- Avoid using classes, prefer functional approach
